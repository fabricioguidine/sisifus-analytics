3. **Local Storage Only**: All input and output files are saved locally
4. **No LLM Calls**: Classification uses keyword matching, so no external API calls are made
5. **No Credentials Required**: You export your emails manually from Google Takeout - no credentials needed!

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📬 How to Get Your Emails

Export your emails from Google Takeout and import them into the application:

### Export from Google Takeout (Gmail):

1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Deselect all"** to start fresh
4. Scroll down and check **"Mail"**
5. Click **"Multiple formats"** next to Mail
   - Select **"mbox"** format
6. Click **"Next step"**
7. Choose:
   - **Delivery method**: "Add to Drive" or "Send download link via email"
   - **Frequency**: "Export once"
   - **File type & size**: Keep defaults
8. Click **"Create export"**
9. Wait for Google to prepare your export (may take hours for large accounts)
10. Download the ZIP file when ready
11. Extract the ZIP file
12. Navigate to the extracted folder structure:
    - `takeout-YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ-XXX-001/Takeout/E-mail/`
    - You'll find `.mbox` files here (e.g., `Todos os e-mails, incluindo Spam e Lixeira-002.mbox`)
    - You can ignore the `Configurações do usuário` folder (it contains settings, not emails)

### Import the exported emails:

```bash
# Option A: Place .mbox file(s) in input folder, then auto-import
# Copy your .mbox file(s) to the input/ folder, then:
python -m src.import_emails

# Option B: Import directly from a specific file
python -m src.import_emails "input/Todos os e-mails, incluindo Spam e Lixeira-002.mbox"

# Option C: Import from Google Takeout folder structure (auto-detects .mbox files)
# If you extracted the entire Takeout folder in input/, it will find .mbox files automatically
python -m src.import_emails
```

**Important Notes:**
- The tool automatically searches for `.mbox` files in the `input/` folder (including subdirectories)
- Configuration files (JSON files in `Configurações do usuário` folder) are automatically ignored
- You can have multiple `.mbox` files - all will be imported
- Only `.mbox` files are supported (Google Takeout format)

**Supported formats:**
- ✅ `.mbox` files (Google Takeout format)

## 💻 Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🧠 Classification Logic

The application uses **keyword-based pattern matching** (no LLM required) to classify emails into job application statuses. The classification process has two main stages:

### Stage 1: Job-Related Filtering

Before classification, emails are filtered to identify job-related content:

- **Job-related emails**: Contain keywords like "job", "application", "interview", "recruiter", "hiring", "position", "candidate", "opportunity", "career", etc.
- **Non-job emails**: Newsletters, promotions, personal emails, spam, etc. are marked as `not_job_related` and excluded from job application statistics
- **Job-related domains**: Emails from known job platforms (LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.) are automatically considered job-related

### Stage 2: Status Classification

Job-related emails are classified into the following statuses using regex pattern matching:

| Status | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **applied** | Initial application submitted | "Thank you for your application", "Application received", "Job opportunity" |
| **confirmation** | Application confirmation received | "We have received your application", "Application successfully received" |
| **interview_1, interview_2, ...** | Interview stages (numbered) | "First interview", "Phone screen", "Technical interview", "Final round" |
| **offer** | Job offer received | "We are pleased to offer", "Job offer", "Congratulations, we'd like to offer" |
| **accepted** | Offer accepted | "I accept", "I'm excited to accept", "Accepting the offer" |
| **rejected** | Application rejected by company | "We regret to inform", "Not selected", "Decided to pursue other candidates" |
| **withdrew** | Application withdrawn by user | "Withdraw application", "No longer interested", "Declined interview" |
| **no_reply** | No clear status (low confidence) | Job-related emails that don't match any specific status pattern |
| **not_job_related** | Non-job emails (excluded from stats) | Newsletters, promotions, personal emails |

### Classification Process

1. **Email Preprocessing**: Extract subject and body text (HTML converted to plain text)
2. **Job Filtering**: Check if email contains job-related keywords or is from a job platform
3. **Pattern Matching**: Search for status-specific keywords in subject and body (first 5000 chars)
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate confidence based on number of matching patterns
5. **Priority Rules**: Higher-priority statuses (e.g., "rejected", "offer") override lower-priority ones
6. **Company Extraction**: Extract company name from email domain or sender name

### Accuracy

The application calculates accuracy as the percentage of emails classified with confidence > 0.5. Typical accuracy ranges from **70-90%** depending on:

- Email wording and clarity
- Language (English vs. Portuguese patterns supported)
- Email quality and formatting
- Presence of standard job application terminology

**Note**: The keyword-based approach is fast and privacy-preserving, but may misclassify:
- Unusual email wording or non-standard formats
- Emails in languages not explicitly supported
- Ambiguous statuses that require context

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Or with verbose output:

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests cover:
- Email classification for each status type
- Priority rules (e.g., rejection overrides other statuses)
- Company name extraction
- Confidence score calculations
- Batch processing

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows a clean, modular architecture:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module has a single responsibility
- **Testability**: Business logic (classifier) is easily testable
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new status types or email providers
- **Configuration**: Settings externalized to config files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of import and parsing errors

## 📋 Status Categories Tracked

The application tracks the following job application statuses:

### Application Flow Statuses

1. **Applied** (`applied`): Initial applications sent by you or job opportunities received
2. **Confirmation** (`confirmation`): Receipt confirmations from companies
3. **Interview Stages** (`interview_1`, `interview_2`, `interview_3`, etc.): Interview rounds (numbered sequentially)
4. **Offer** (`offer`): Job offers received from companies
5. **Accepted** (`accepted`): Offers you accepted

### Outcome Statuses

6. **Rejected** (`rejected`): Applications rejected by the company (consolidated in Sankey diagram)
7. **Withdrew** (`withdrew`): Applications you withdrew or declined (consolidated in Sankey diagram)
8. **Ghosted** (`no_reply` + `no_progress_after_interview_X`): No response received, consolidated into single "Ghosted" node in Sankey diagram

### Excluded Statuses

9. **Not Job Related** (`not_job_related`): Non-job emails excluded from application statistics

### Sankey Diagram Consolidation

In the Sankey diagram visualization, similar statuses are consolidated for clarity:

- **Rejected**: All rejection types (direct and after interviews) → Single "Rejected" node
- **Withdrew**: All withdrawal types (direct and after interviews) → Single "Withdrew" node  
- **Ghosted**: "No Reply" and "No Progress After Interview X" → Single "Ghosted" node

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Classification Limitations

1. **Keyword-Based Approach**
   - Classification relies on pattern matching, so unusual email wording may be misclassified
   - Emails with non-standard formats or creative language may not match patterns
   - Context-dependent emails (e.g., sarcasm, informal language) may be misclassified
   - **Accuracy**: Typically 70-90% depending on email quality and wording

2. **Language Support**
   - Primary support for **English** and **Portuguese** keywords
   - Other languages may have lower accuracy
   - Mixed-language emails may not be classified correctly

3. **Status Ambiguity**
   - Some emails may match multiple status patterns (priority rules apply)
   - Low-confidence emails are classified as `no_reply`
   - Edge cases (e.g., "we decided not to proceed" from user vs. company) may be misclassified

4. **Company Name Extraction**
   - Relies on email domains (e.g., `noreply@company.com` → "company")
   - May not always extract the correct company name
   - Generic domains (gmail.com, outlook.com) may result in "Unknown" company
   - Third-party recruiters may show recruiter company instead of actual employer

5. **Interview Stage Detection**
   - Stages are detected from email content (e.g., "first interview", "final round")
   - If stage numbers aren't explicit, may not be numbered correctly
   - Missing intermediate stages are inferred in the Sankey diagram

### Data Limitations

6. **Email Import**
   - Only supports `.mbox` format (Google Takeout)
   - Corrupted or malformed emails may be skipped
   - Very large files (>500MB) may take significant time to import

7. **Sankey Diagram Assumptions**
   - Assumes linear progression: applications → interviews → offers
   - Non-linear flows (e.g., direct offers without interviews) are handled but may look unusual
   - Missing intermediate interview stages are estimated from higher stages

8. **Performance**
   - Very large datasets (500K+ emails) may require:
     - 4-8 GB RAM
     - 30+ minutes processing time
     - Significant disk space (2-4 GB)
   - Date filtering is recommended for large datasets

### Known Edge Cases

- **False Positives**: Non-job emails may be classified as job-related if they contain job keywords
- **False Negatives**: Job emails with unusual wording may be marked as `not_job_related`
- **Rejection vs. Withdrawal**: May misclassify user declines as company rejections (or vice versa) if language is ambiguous
- **Multiple Companies**: Emails from third-party recruiters may show recruiter company instead of actual employer

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Import Issues

- Ensure your `.mbox` file is not corrupted
- Check that the file path is correct
- Verify the file format is `.mbox` (Google Takeout format)
- The tool automatically ignores configuration folders (`Configurações do usuário`)
- Make sure the `.mbox` file is in the `input/` folder or a subdirectory

### Low Accuracy

- Review the `applications.csv` file to see confidence scores
- Emails with low confidence (< 0.5) might need manual review
- Consider adding more keywords to `classifier.py` if you notice patterns

### No Emails Found

- Ensure you've successfully imported emails using `python -m src.import_emails`
- Check that `input/emails.json` exists and contains email data
- Verify your exported file contains job-related emails
